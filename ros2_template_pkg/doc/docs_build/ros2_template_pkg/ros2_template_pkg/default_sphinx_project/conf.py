# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
# import os
# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = 'ros2_template_pkg'
# TODO(tfoote) The docs say year and author but we have this and it seems more relevant.

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
## rosdoc2 will extend the extensions to enable Breathe and Exhale if you
## do not add them here, as well as others, perhaps.
## If you add them manually rosdoc2 may still try to configure them.
## See the rosdoc2_settings below for some options on avoiding that.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# a list of builtin themes.

## rosdoc2 will override the theme, but you may set one here for running Sphinx
## without the rosdoc2 tool.

    ## This setting, if provided, allows option specification for breathe
    ## directives through exhale. If not set, exhale defaults will be used.

    ## a consistent style across all of the ROS documentation.
    # 'override_theme': True,

    ## This setting, if True, will automatically extend the intersphinx mapping
    ## using inventory files found in the cross-reference directory.
    ## If false, the `found_intersphinx_mappings` variable will be in the global
    ## scope when run with rosdoc2, and could be conditionally used in your own
    ## Sphinx conf.py file.
